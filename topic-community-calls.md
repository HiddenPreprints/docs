Take advantage of OpenCon infrastructure & refocus on DEI?

* Exchange efforts to tackle DEI issues in preprints -- reduce vulnerability as lone passion projects, improve shared practices, take on the work of pointing out obvious flaws & educating ourselves (without the under-served communities having to do this repeatedly) -- DS, JP, me, sbotlite, who's interested in sprint project?...
* Invite talks from DEI practitioners in other spaces to share what they did, learned, get their advice, etc. (e.g. Dario - perspective as practitioner in p2p creation with Wiki)

An extension of OpenAsInBook - read critical literature and discuss it, not preprint-bound; then bring what we learn in book convos to this community call

Influence ASAPbio ambassador activities (and open to ambassadors too) --> how to ensure we stimulate productive conversations about preprinting that centre DEI issues (instead of these being add-ons). [Is this divergent from our role to increase awareness of preprints??]

Apply Open Leader principles in how these calls are run -- best practice leadership, transparency, emergent strategy style not top-down
