# eLife Sprint working doc project pitch for sprint docs

Status: draft

Problem statement: As a reader (and commenter/PREreviewer/PreLighter) of preprints, I would like to find preprints by authors with typically low visibility who are preprinting for the first time in order to prioritise reading & providing feedback on their preprints (and intentionally contribute to making preprints a success for everyone). This needs to be easy for me: I am motivated to counteract attention bias but I have little time to spend finding such preprints; I need to spend any time I have on the reading & writing about them.

**One-liner:** a prototype tool based on opinionated rules that filters a feed of preprints for indicators of lower visibility of the author (first author?), such as:  
* gender {female, see [sbotlite](https://sbotlite.github.io/) for how they estimate gender}
* geography {institutional affiliation, country -- e.g., countries with low [passport index](https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php) for whom attending international conferences may be more difficult}
* twitter reach [follower count of authors]
* first-time preprinter [first author name&affiliation / ORCID doesn't match pre-existing preprints])
* ethnicity -- I think this would not be possible
The prototype should pick 1-2 simple rules only and may be restricted to a specific server (or set of servers) for which a feed is available and the metadata is sufficient to filter for preprints according to the rule above.

**Links/notes:** This project has a github repo at github.com/npscience/equitable-preprints, containing further [background information](https://github.com/npscience/equitable-preprints/blob/master/elife-sprint-2019/equity-in-preprints-background-notes.md) to this idea and our expectations for where it might go next.

**Resources that may be helpful:**
* biorXiv metadata dump (retrievable from rxivist data?)
* eupmc data access (e.g., API or dump)
* [getpreprints](https://github.com/PREreview/getpreprints) module (PREreview, documentation to be udated)

**Call for contributors:** Are there particular skills that the project needs?  
(1) Developer(s)/data scientist(s) to write script to apply rule to a dataset of preprints and produce a tool that displays the filtered or marked output. Interoperability with existing preprint server(s) and third-party preprint commentary initiatives (PreLights, PreLists, PREreview, etc. would be helpful);  
(2) Users: researchers, preprint commentary initiative leads & contributors;  
(3) Scientometrics/ethics specialist: how to create these filtering rules? How to be transparent?;  
(4) Someone(s) who would be interested to take project forward if prototype/idea is useful;  
(5) Someone who can design a nice web presence for the tool

**Interested contributors:** please list yourself here if you are interested in contributing to this idea at the Sprint.
